# VEX IQ PID AUTON LEAK


Hello viewer,
I am the coder for 16688C, and this code is my project!
This PID code is designed to make autnomous consistent.

This code contains tuning constants like kp ki kd and the values I used for my team's robot is not the same as the one for your robot due to factors like weight and different types of drivetrain transmission. You need to tune the constants for own robot.

If the code doesnt work(e.g. overshooting/undershooting or drifting to one side) it's probably because you didnt tune the constants. 

I worked hard on this code for weeks (Noah 10851B can tell you my pain) so please respect my work by **trying to understand what the code is doing before blindly plugging in the code.**

I hope that you find my code useful!

**IMPORTANT REMINDER:** I know that PID is a hard concept but before you just plug in the code for your auton, **TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE CODE FIRST.**
